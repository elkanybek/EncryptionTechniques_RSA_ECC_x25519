## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced techniques for encrypting and decrypting messages using various cryptographic algorithms. Messages are embedded within images using steganography, enabling secure and covert data transfer. The project supports three encryption schemes: **RSA**, **ECC**, and **X25519**. It uses **Gradio** for a user-friendly interface, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages effortlessly.

## Features
- **RSA Encryption/Decryption**: Asymmetric cryptography.
- **ECC Encryption/Decryption**: Uses AES-GCM with keys derived from elliptic curve key exchange.
- **X25519 Encryption/Decryption**: Lightweight and fast asymmetric cryptography.
- **Image Steganography**: Embeds encrypted messages into images using `steghide`.
- **Gradio UI**: Provides an intuitive interface for encryption, decryption, and key generation.
